ABOUT THE ALL BASIC CODE ARCHIVES
---------------------------------

  The All BASIC Code (ABC) Archives contains hundreds of BASIC source codes
  ranging from ASIC/LibertyBASIC/QB/QBasic/PDS/PowerBASIC/VBDOS/VBWIN, and
  various other BASIC languages (like BasicBasic).  These source codes are
  collected from various resources, mainly individual programmers who summit
  their code via e-mail, the FidoNet QUIK_BAS Echo, and BASIC newsgroups.
  The ABC Archives operates similarily with respect to the SWAG Archives.
  Both source code archives survives with contributions from people like YOU.
  Many thanks to those who have contributed, and of course, for your support!
  For more on the SWAG Archives (Pascal snippets), please visit their
  homepage at  http://www.gdsoft.com/swag/swag.html


ABOUT THE ABC READER CA FOR WINDOWS 95
--------------------------------------

  The All BASIC Code Reader '95 was developed under Windows 98, and was test
  on a 486/66 running Windows '95, and P200 running Windows 98/NT.  Thanks to
  all beta testers and their helpful input!  As always, free software doesn't
  come 100% bug-free, nor does commercial software, but anyway, if you do find
  any annoying errors, you are advised to e-mail the author: William Yu at
  voxel@edmc.net  Your comments and suggestions are always welcome!
  If you didn't already know, an ABC (All BASIC Code Reader) is a program
  to read ABC Packets.  For example, GAMES.ABC may contain hundreds of
  individual snippets, the ABC Reader is used much like a database reader,
  all the information is in the GAMES.ABC Packet, and GAMES.IDX is used to
  index it.  The Packet structures have been documented in ABC.ABC.
  The ABC Reader '95 was developed in the Windows '98 environment, using
  Inprises' (Borland) Delphi v3.0
  This is an OFFICIAL ABC Reader, please accept no substitutes.

GETTING STARTED
---------------

  If you've never used any of the previous ABC Readers before, you will
  probably be confused with the ABC Packet installation process.
  Unlike the DOS ABC Readers, the Windows version does not detect if new
  ABC Installation Packets are ready for unpacking.

  So what the heck are ABC Installation Packets you ask?
  They are the files contained in ABCyymm.ZIP (where yy=year, mm=month)
  If you haven't downloaded any, please do so, as the ABC Reader is useless
  otherwise. Read on to "ABC PACKETS" for more information.

  It's advised that you unzip the ABCyymm.ZIP file into the directory where
  your ABC95.EXE program resides.  All subsequent ABC Packets should also
  be unzipped in that same directory for cataloguing.


ABC PACKETS
